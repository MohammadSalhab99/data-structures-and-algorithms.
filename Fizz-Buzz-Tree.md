# Challenge Summary
Write a function called fizz buzz tree
    Arguments: k-ary tree
    Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

        If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
        If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
        If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
        If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
