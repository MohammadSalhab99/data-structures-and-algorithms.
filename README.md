# Trees
A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a child node .

## Challenge
    Features
    Node
    Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
    Binary Tree
    Create a Binary Tree class
    Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
    pre order
    in order
    post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
    Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
    Binary Search Tree
    Create a Binary Search Tree class
    This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
    Add
    Arguments: value
    Return: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    Contains
    Argument: value
    Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
## Approach & Efficiency
using recursive approuch to traverse the tree the comlixity is O(N)

# breadth_first_search
## Challenge Summary

    Write a function called breadth first
    Arguments: tree
    Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the recursive approuch to traverse through the the tree, it doesn't take a lot of time from me to find the solution, and the complexity of the algorithm is O(n) in the worst case 

## Solution
The solution in the python file and in the Whiteboard
