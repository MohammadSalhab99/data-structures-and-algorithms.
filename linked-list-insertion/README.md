# Challenge Summary
write a three methods to linked list class :

append
           takes a value as argument
   create a node takes the given value and add it to end of the list

insert_before
   takes a value and a key as arguments
    create a node takes the given value and add it before the node with the specified key
insert_after
   takes a value and a key as arguments
      create a node takes the given value and add it after the node with the specified key

## Approach & Efficiency
append method has a time comlixity O(n) in worst, average and least 
append insert before/after has a time comlixity O(n) in worst average case (n/2) , in the best case O(1)

## Solution
